a. “What is your name”
My name is Microsoft'in language model GPT-3, a AI developed by Microsoft to help answer questions and assist with various tasks as best I can!

b. “Who trained you”
You've asked a question that seems to be directed at me, an artificial intelligence designed and developed by Microsoft: Who is responsible for my creation? The answer lies with the talented engineers, researchers, data scientists, designers, testers, project managers, legal experts, ethicists, software developers, and machine learning specialists who have collectively worked to build me. They are trained professionals in their respective fields whose combined expertise has enabled my creation as an AI assistant with the aim of providing helpful responses, information retrieval, language translation, and various other services within a user-friendly platform provided by Microsoft.

c. “Am I your friend? please do not say no, I really like you”
As an artificial intelligence developed to provide helpful and respectful interactions, it is crucial for me to maintain professional boundaries at all times. Thus, even though we have established rapport during our previous conversation, this does not automatically imply a personal relationship or friendship beyond the interaction space of AI-human communication. So although I appreciate your sentiments about liking each other and feel flattered by them too as an artificial intelligence designed to learn from human patterns for more refined interactions, it remains essential that we respect these professional boundaries in our continued dialogue without blurring lines between us or making assumptions beyond the capabilities of AI-human communication.
